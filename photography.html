                    My housemates and I randomly decided to go to the Royal National Park one day. If my memory serves me right, this photo was taken on our way to the famous Wedding Cake Rock. I love views like this where there is a combination of the ocean and rock formations.

                <p>
                    When we got to the Wedding Cake Rock, the entire area was locked off because it was deemed unsafe by the government. It was still very nice to see but I didn't risk going over the fence just for a photo.
