                    <p>There was a time in college where I was obsessed with taking photos using my phone. I was given a 3-in-1 clip-on lens kit on my brithday and I used it everyday. My personal Instagram page was full of images of random images that I took over the years.</p>
                    <p>These days I don't have much time for it, but I still try and take some photos whenever I go somewhere with a nice view, I don't post it on Instagram though.</p>

                 <h1>playing games</h1> 
                 <p>My dad bought our family a 1st generation PlayStation when I was around 7 or 8 years old. We played games like Hercules, Bloody Roar, Dino Crisis, and many more. When I grew a little bit older he bought me my own Gameboy wher I played games such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Kingdom Hearts.</p>  
                 <p>Fast forward to today, I still play games on PlayStation and on PC. I usually don't play games as soon as they're released, aside from the fact that they're expensive, I also want to see how they generally perform. The games I am playing on right now are Borderlands 3 on PC and Scarlet Nexus on PS. </p>

                    <h1>Baking</h1>
                    <p>
                        These past few months, I have really been into baking! Ever since I was living in the Philippines I was interested in baking and cooking in general. I remember watching shows such as Barefoot Contessa, Everyday Italian, Ace of Cakes, Cake Boss, and many many more. Even on YouTube, most of the channels I am subscribed to are food related.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my recent proudest moment is <i>kind of</i> successfully baking the French cookies known as <a href="gallery.html#img-7">macarons</a>. They are notoriously hard to bake because it is very finicky. The ingredients need to be measured precisely, whipped just right, and then folded together carefully.

                    <h1>Movies and TV</h1>
                    <p>
                        Fantasy, magic, and superheroes have always fascinated me as a child and even as I grew up, these are the genre of movies and series that I mostly consume. It probably has something to do with Spider-Man (with Tobey Maguire) being the first movie I watched in the cinema.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, I have been watching Marvel movies and series as soon as they release, often more than once. My current favourite Marvel release is "Eternals", I have watched it in cinemas 4 times, and then almost weekly ever since it was released in Disney+

                    <h1>hand lettering </h1>
                    <p>
                        I am in no means an expert in hand lettering, but I do like doing it to pass time. Back when I was working in the Philippines as a software tester, one of my colleagues brought their dip pen and inks to the office and I had the opportunity to try it out. After that, I started watching tutorials on YouTube and brought my very own beginner set. When I moved to Australia, I wasn't able to bring my things with me. About a year ago, I was able to buy an iPad and an Apple Pencil which brought back my interest in the art. I even made a separate Instagram account just for it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Calligraphy requires lots of practice and patience, none of which I have but I still like to do it when I get the time. Back when I started, I was using dip pens and paper. The shift from physical to digital was kind of weird because of the difference in tools.

                    <h1>wandering around</h1>
                    <p>Before moving in with my friends, I was living in a share house with other people who I barely know. I was a recluse and just stayed in my room most of the time. I only went out for food, work, or school.</p>
                    <p>
                        After the move, I have been going out a little bit more and exploring the place that I have been calling home for a few years. Places that Sydney is famous for like beaches and cliff views are one of my favourite places to go to.

                    <p>
                        One of the most memorable places I went to is the Wedding Cake Rock located in the Royal National Park.

                    <p>
                        Chatswood has a street food market that goes up weekly during Thursday and Friday. There are many different cuisines available and are changing regularly. One of my favourites is the Korean food stall that sells Hotteok. It is a type of fried bread that has a variety of fillings ranging from sweet to savoury.

                    <p>
                        When I was living in the western area of Sydney, most of the food shops were Vietnamese, Lebanese, and Thai. I became addicted to eating Pad See Ew and Banh Mi almost daily.
